# FeynmanKacParticleFilters


A package to perform particle filtering (and smoothing) written using the Feynman-Kac formalism.

Implemented as an example:
- [Cox-Ingersoll-Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross_model)

Outputs:
- Marginal likelihood
- Samples from the filtering distribution

Implemented:
- Bootstrap particle filter with adaptive resampling.
